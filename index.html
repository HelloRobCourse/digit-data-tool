    <h1>Handwriting Dataset Tool</h1>
    <p>Use this tool to check your submission for the handwriting dataset. Follow these guidelines for generating your digit samples:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Draw in black ink on a white background,</li>
      <li>Make sure the image is a perfect square,</li>
      <li>Use a thick pen stroke to draw the numbers,</li>
      <li>Draw the number centered in the image, and as large as possible in the image.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <b>It is your responsibility to make sure the images look good when they are 28 by 28 pixels and in black and white.</b> The tool will only check that your image is a square and show you what it looks like scaled to the size required in the dataset.
      The lines should not be too thick or too thin.
    </p>

    <p>When the status button reads &quot;Complete&quot;, you are ready to return to the submission form and submit your images.</p>

    <div id="app-root" class="container">
    </div>

    <p>Do your handwriting samples compare to the samples from MNIST? They should take up about the same portion of the image and have similar line thickness.</p>
